# What is Patata

Patata is a project to help you to automate UI testing of native apps. It uses Cucumber and Appium to make the process as approachable as possible.

It uses Behavioral Driven Development as technique to test our products, separating what is specific for a platform to what is specific for our tests.

Its goal is the reusability, where specifications can be shared between different project in an organization. For instance, having a the product implemented on iOS and Android and sharing the same testing code for all of them!

# Where is the documentation?

The documentation was growing and it has been moved to a GitHub page: **[http://patata.io][patata-url]**
